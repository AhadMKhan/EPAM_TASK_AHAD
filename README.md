## How to clone a repository:
1. Open the partition of your computer HDD, either **C:/** or **D:/**.
2. Create a folder or directory.
3. Open Git Bash, Git UI, or cmd, whichever you prefer.
4. Run the command ***`git clone https://github.com/AhadMKhan/EPAM_TASK_AHAD.git`***.
5. The repository will be cloned, and you can view the tasks in your choice of editor.
  
## Task 1
**1. Write a list of different test cases to check this feature and the integrity of new entity StudyGroups according to the acceptance criteria:**
   1. Describe some high-level steps and expectations (you can make assumptions of how the app works - just explain it)
   2. Highlight what are the inputs you will be using on each test case
   3. Define the testing level of this test case: unit testing, component testing, or e2e testing (manual) - considering that:
      1. We have a unit test framework in TestApp using NUnit framework
      2. We have a component test framework in our TestAppAPI using NUnit framework
      3. We don't have any automation to test the UI, so manual testing will be required on the e2e level.
   4. Consider if you want to add all test cases to regression or not
