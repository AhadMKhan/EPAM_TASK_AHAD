# EPAM_TASK_AHAD

## Task 1
1.	Write a list of different test cases to check this feature and the integrity of new entity StudyGroups according to the acceptance criteria:
      1. Describe some high level steps and expectations (you can make assumptions of how the app works - just explain it)
      2. Highlight what are the inputs you will be using on each test case
      3. Define testing level of this test case: unit testing, component testing or e2e testing (manual) - considering that:
            1. We have a unit test framework in TestApp using Nunit framework
            2. We have a component test framework in our TestAppAPI using Nunit framework
            3. We don't have any automation to test the UI, so manual testing will be required on e2e level.
      4. Consider if you want to add all test cases to regression or not
